Growing beef takes as much as 100 times more land than growing peas or soya to produce the same amount of protein. Iâ€™ve reduced my meat consumption to some local, organic grass-fed red meat or a roast chicken as an occasional treat once or twice a month. This allows me to enjoy meat as part of my diet at a more sustainable level."
